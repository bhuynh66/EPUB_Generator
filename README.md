# Epub Generator

This is a simple program that takes as input text files or folder and converts them into an epub.


## How to use

Run the program in the terminal 

> python epub.py

then follow the on screen instructions. 



## Notes

1. Requires python 3.x

2. Directories are case insensitive. For example, suppose you have 2 folders say, Pop and PoP. Then both of them  would be consider the same folder.

3. When opting to manually input the text files, the order in which you choose will
decide the order of the chapters. Say you select cat.txt, dog.txt, elephant.txt then the program will create the chapters call cat, dog, elephant in that order.
